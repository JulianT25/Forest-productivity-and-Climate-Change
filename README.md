# Forest-productivity-and-Climate-Change
This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures and analyses presented in the paper titled "Forest productivity decreases in response to recent changes in vegetation structure and climate in the latitudinal extremes of the European continent."

File: Data_GEB  : Contains the data required to obtain the results from scripts 1 to 4 and 6 in the repository.

File: models_GEB_RF52_72 This file is used to represent the coefficients of the models in the script 4_Models_and_coefficient_representation.R (Figure 5 of the paper).

File: VarImp_GEB Used in the script 5_Vars_Importance_representation to represent the importance of variables, as shown in Figure 4 of the paper.
